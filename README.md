## Quick start

Original repor was taken from *chainstacklab*:
Original code here:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/chainstacklabs/zk-battleship-game-hardhat.git
```

Install dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Run tests:

```shell
npx hardhat test
```

Add environment variables to `.env.sample` and rename to `.env`:


> In this specific version we specify the account playing by taking the private key from the environment variable. Develop this further by adding a user interface.

```env
ALT_ENDPOINT="ALT_ENDPOINT"
PRIVATE_KEY="PRIVATE_KEY_1"
PRIVATE_KEY_2="PRIVATE_KEY_2"
```
Deploy the smart contract:

```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network alt
```

or 

```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network alt
```

Now the contract will be deployed and verified on Etherscan.
